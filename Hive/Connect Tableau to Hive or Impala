Prerequisite: Download the SSL Certificate

Download the Hortonworks ODBC Driver for Apache Hive 
from https://hortonworks.com/downloads/#addons. 
Next, extract and install the driver.

Check whether your odbc driver version correct? 
  Cloudera ODBC driver 2.5.28 does not support Tableau with Impala.
Did you choose the right port number or login type? 
  Impala port number is 21000 and 21050. Hive is 10000.

Launch Tableau. 
If you do not already have Tableau, you can download a trial version from https://www.tableau.com/trial/download-tableau.

In Tableau, create a connection to a “Hortonworks Hadoop Hive” server. Enter the following:

Property::	Value
Server::	Enter the public hostname of your controller node instance.
Port::	443
Type::	HiveServer2
Authentication::	Username and Password
Transport:: HTTP
Username::	Enter the cluster username created when creating your cluster
Password::	Enter the cluster password created when creating your cluster

Check the Require SSL checkbox.

Click on the text underneath the checkbox to add a configuration file link.

Specify to use a custom SSL certificate, and then browse to the SSL certificate gateway.pem file 
that was generated when you downloaded the SSL certificate as a prerequisite.

Click OK.
